      Available in indefinite sizes, small, large and extra-large, with fabrics
      ranging from khadi to nylon and cotton to silk, Clothes are one of the
      Indispensable necessities for the survival of humankind, which defies any
      classification pertaining to richness or age. Right from the Stone Age,
      clothes have served their basic primary purpose of providing protection
      from the negative effects of the environs, namely heat and cold, dust and
      rain, although the pre- historic apparels were an animal’s skin and the
      present age attires are of animal’s print. Varieties of clothes are
      inexhaustible, from cotton, light- colored clothes in summers to the
      woolen, furry jackets and sweaters in the winters, casual tees for an
      outing with a friend and bejeweled ethnics for that same friend’s wedding.
      Even different regions have their own indigenous clothing, the extremity
      of which is evident in India itself, ghaghra- choli in Gujarat and saree
      in Maharashtra, lungi in Tamil Nadu and kurta- pajama in Bihar. Life
      without air is definitely impossible but life without clothes is surely
      indignant, if not unreasonable, it is because of this reason that donating
      clothes is no less than providing a hungry food, or giving the homeless
      shelter. Clothes have an eminent role to play and the proof can be
      statistically claimed with the burgeoning number of customers attracted by
      a small garments shop even in a remote locality.
